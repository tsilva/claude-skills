# README Generator

Create READMEs that hook readers in 5 seconds, prove value in 30 seconds, and enable success in under 10 minutes.

## Core Framework: Hook → Prove → Enable → Extend

Every README follows this psychological progression:

| Phase | Time | Purpose | Elements |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Hook** | 0-5 sec | Instant recognition | Logo + badges + one-liner + demo visual |
| **Prove** | 5-30 sec | Build credibility | Social proof, features, trust signals |
| **Enable** | 30 sec - 10 min | Immediate success | One-liner install + working example |
| **Extend** | Committed users | Deep engagement | Docs links, contributing, API reference |

**The goal: Time to first success under 10 minutes.**

The first 5-10 lines visible without scrolling determine whether users stay or leave.

## Logo Generation (Mandatory)

Every README must have a logo. Follow this process:

### Step 1: Check for Existing Logo

Look for `logo.png` at the repo root. If found, use it and skip to README generation.

### Step 2: Generate Logo (if missing)

Invoke the **repo-logo-generator** skill to generate a logo. That skill contains the prompt templates, visual metaphors, and technical requirements for logo generation.

### Step 3: Determine Logo Display Size

For crisp display on retina/high-DPI screens, set the HTML width to **half the actual image width**:

1. Get the image dimensions:
   ```bash
   sips -g pixelWidth logo.png 2>/dev/null | grep pixelWidth | awk '{print $2}'
   ```

2. Divide by 2 for the display width (e.g., 512px image → `width="256"`)

3. Use the calculated width in the HTML img tag

This ensures the logo renders at native resolution on 2x displays while maintaining appropriate size on standard displays.

### Dark/Light Mode Support

For theme-aware logos, use the `<picture>` element:

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="logo-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="logo-light.png">
  <img src="logo-light.png" alt="Project Name" width="{DISPLAY_WIDTH}">
</picture>
```

## Hero Section

The hero section is the most critical part of the README. It must be center-aligned and contain these elements in order:

### Title Rule

**The title must be exactly the same as the repository name.** Preserve the original casing and formatting:
- If the repo is `my-awesome-tool`, the title is `my-awesome-tool` (not "My Awesome Tool")
- If the repo is `fastAPI`, the title is `fastAPI` (not "FastAPI" or "Fastapi")
- If the repo is `README-Generator`, the title is `README-Generator`

Do not "prettify" or transform the repo name. Use it verbatim as the H1 title.

```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Project Name" width="{DISPLAY_WIDTH}"/>

  [![Build](badge)](link) [![Version](badge)](link) [![License](badge)](link)

  **A clear, catchy one-liner that explains what this does and why it matters**

  [Documentation](url) · [Demo](url) · [Discord](url)
</div>
```

### Hero Element Requirements

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Logo | Width = half actual pixels (for retina), centered |
| Badges | 3-6 maximum, shields.io for consistency |
| Tagline | One sentence with emoji(s), max 350 chars (fits GitHub "About" field) |
| Quick links | Docs, demo, community (if available) |

### Tagline Patterns That Work

**Rules:**
- **Must include emoji(s)** - 1-3 relevant emojis that reinforce the message
- **Max 350 characters** - fits GitHub's "About → Description" field
- **Ideal length: 80-150 chars** - punchy and scannable

Good taglines lead with benefits, not features:

- ✅ "🔧 Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command"
- ✅ "⚡ High-performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production"
- ✅ "🚀 A blazing fast CLI for X"
- ✅ "🛠️ Build, test, and deploy with zero config"
- ❌ "A Python library for doing Y" (no emoji, too generic)
- ❌ "Version 2.0 of the Z project" (no emoji, self-focused)

### GIF Demo Placement

For CLI tools, place an animated GIF demo **immediately after the tagline**. This is the single most distinctive pattern across successful CLI projects (thefuck, lazygit, fzf, bat).

## Badges

Use 4-7 badges in this priority order:

1. **Build/CI status** - project health
2. **Code coverage** - quality signal
3. **Version/release** - active development
4. **License** - legal clarity
5. **Downloads** - adoption proof
6. **Discord/community** - engagement signal

### Badge Implementation

```markdown
[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/user/repo/ci.yml?branch=main)](link)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/user/repo)](link)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/package-name)](link)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](link)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/package-name)](link)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/SERVER_ID)](link)
```

**Rules:**
- Use shields.io for all badges (consistent styling)
- Pick one style (flat, flat-square, for-the-badge) and use it consistently
- For CLI tools, include a Repology badge showing packaging status

## Visual Elements

### GIF Demos (Mandatory for CLI Tools)

Terminal recordings are mandatory for CLI tools. Use:
- **vhs** - scripted terminal GIFs (recommended)
- **terminalizer** - interactive recording
- **asciinema** - terminal session sharing

**GIF Requirements:**
- Under 10MB (GitHub limit)
- 10-15fps is sufficient
- Show the "aha moment" - core value in action
- Drag-drop into README editor to host on GitHub's CDN

### Screenshots

For UI-heavy projects:
- Include both light and dark mode versions
- Compress before adding (ImageOptim, XConvert)
- Use descriptive alt text

### Tables

Use tables for:
- Feature comparisons
- API parameters
- Benchmark results
- Installation matrices (cross-platform)

### Architecture Diagrams

For complex projects, use Mermaid (GitHub-native):

```markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[Output]
```
```

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone

- **Active voice, imperative mood**: "Install the package" not "The package can be installed"
- **Second person**: "You can configure..." not "Users can configure..."
- **Present tense**: "This library handles..." feels immediate
- **Contractions**: "don't," "it's," "you'll" create conversational tone

### Structure

- Maximum 3-5 lines per paragraph
- One concept per paragraph
- 80-character line width for readability

### Emoji Strategy

Strategic emojis boost engagement:

| Location | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Section headers | 🚀 Quick Start, ⚙️ Config, 📦 Install | Visual navigation |
| Feature bullets | ✨ New, ⚡ Fast, 🔒 Secure | Scannable benefits |
| Status indicators | ✅ Done, ⏳ WIP, ❌ Deprecated | Quick comprehension |
| CTAs | ⭐ Star us!, 🤝 Contribute | Engagement boost |

**Rules**: 1-2 per section max. Never in code blocks. Consistent style throughout.

### Anti-Pattern

Focus on user benefits, not project history or developer achievements. The README is for users, not a changelog.

## Engagement Boosters

### Humor That Works

Subtle, inclusive humor increases engagement:
- **Self-aware**: "Yes, another X. But hear us out..."
- **Relatable pain**: "We got tired of Y, so we built this"
- **Easter eggs**: Hidden features for curious readers

Avoid: Dated memes, inside jokes, anything requiring context.

## README by Project Type

For detailed templates and examples by project type (AI/ML, CLI, Libraries, Web Apps), see [references/project-types.md](references/project-types.md).

## Social Proof

### "Used By" Section

Place prominently after hero section with 6-12 company logos:

```markdown
## Used By

<p align="center">
  <img src="logos/company1.svg" alt="Company 1" height="40">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="logos/company2.svg" alt="Company 2" height="40">
</p>
```

### Star CTA

Engaging call-to-action patterns:
- `⭐ Star if this saved you hours of debugging!`
- `🌟 If this helped, a star would make our day!`

**Rules**: One CTA max. Humor optional but never cringe. Self-deprecation > bragging.

### Community Links

```markdown
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/SERVER_ID?label=Discord&logo=discord)](link)
[![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/handle?style=social)](link)
```

### Supporting Files

These files signal project maturity:
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- SECURITY.md
- LICENSE

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these mistakes:

| Anti-Pattern | Problem |
|--------------|---------|
| No README or empty README | Single worst error |
| Wall of text | No structure, long paragraphs |
| Missing install instructions | Users immediately lost |
| Scary build instructions upfront | `git clone; cmake...` scares users |
| No visual demonstration | Text-only descriptions of visual software |
| Outdated information | Erodes trust |
| API-dump documentation | README shouldn't be complete API reference |
| Redundant information | Repeating title (already in URL) |
| Inconsistent formatting | Mixed badge styles, varying headers |
| Self-focused writing | Developer achievements over user benefits |
| Emoji overload 🎉🚀✨💯🔥 | Visual noise, unprofessional |

## Workflow

1. **Analyze project** - scan for package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.
2. **Detect project type** - CLI, library, AI/ML, web app, API
3. **Extract metadata** - name, description, version, author, license
4. **Check for existing logo** - look for `logo.png` at repo root
5. **Generate logo if missing** - use repo-logo-generator skill
6. **Calculate display width** - use half the actual image pixel width (for retina displays)
7. **Generate README.md** - following Hook → Prove → Enable → Extend structure
