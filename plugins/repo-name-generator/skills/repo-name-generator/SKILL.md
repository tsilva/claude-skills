# Repo Name Generator

Generate 6 creative, memorable repository names optimized for virality.

## Quick Start

```
/repo-name-generator           # Analyze current directory
/repo-name-generator ./path    # Analyze specific path
```

## Workflow

1. **Project Analysis** - Examine available files to understand the project
2. **Apply Virality Criteria** - Score names against viral factors
3. **Generate Diverse Names** - Create names across different styles

### Project Analysis

Examine available files to understand the project:

| File | What to Extract |
|------|-----------------|
| README.md | Project description, purpose |
| package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod | Name, description, keywords |
| Main source files | Core functionality |
| Current repo name | Context for renaming |

### Virality Criteria

| Factor | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Memorable** | Short, easy to spell/say | `vite`, `bun`, `deno` |
| **Searchable** | Unique, SEO-friendly | `fastapi`, `prisma` |
| **Shareable** | Fun to mention | `husky`, `panda` |
| **Descriptive** | Hints at purpose | `typescript`, `autoprefixer` |
| **Clever** | Wordplay, metaphors | `yarn`, `brew`, `nest` |

### Name Styles

Generate at least one name per style:

| Style | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Creative** | Metaphors, abstract concepts (phoenix, aurora) |
| **Professional** | Clean, corporate-friendly (dataforge, apikit) |
| **Playful** | Fun animals/objects (otter, rocket) |
| **Technical** | Describes function directly (quicksort, logstream) |
| **Punny** | Wordplay, tech jokes (gitgud, ctrl-z) |

## Output Format

Present exactly 6 name suggestions in this format:

```markdown
## Suggested Repository Names

### 1. **name-here**
> Tagline that captures the essence

**Style:** Creative | **Why it works:** Brief explanation of virality factors

---

### 2. **another-name**
> Another compelling tagline

**Style:** Professional | **Why it works:** Explanation

---

(continue for all 6 suggestions)
```

## Guidelines

- Names should be lowercase, hyphenated if multi-word
- Prefer 1-2 words (max 3)
- Avoid names already taken by popular projects
- Include mix of safe and bold options
- Consider domain availability patterns (.io, .dev, .sh)
